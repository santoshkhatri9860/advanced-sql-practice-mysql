# Quickstart (MySQL)

This repo is a practice-first SQL workbook (prompts + solutions).  
You can run it in two ways:

1) **Local MySQL (recommended)** — fastest if you already have MySQL installed  
2) **Docker** — optional if you have Docker installed

---

## Option 1 (Recommended): Local MySQL (macOS socket)

### 1) Confirm MySQL is running (socket)
```bash
ls -l /tmp/mysql.sock
