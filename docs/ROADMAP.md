# Roadmap

## Current status
- Organizing original work into a clean, sequenced workbook (no omissions)
- Keeping prompts and solutions separate for practice-first learning

## Next improvements
- Add difficulty tags (Easy / Medium / Hard)
- Add curated “Interview Sets” (common patterns recruiters test)
- Add expected output examples for selected exercises
- Add automated formatting/lint checks (optional)

## Suggestions welcome
Open an issue with:
- Topic name
- What you want added/changed
- Example question style (if possible)
