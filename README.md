# Advanced SQL workbook: subqueries, window functions, CTEs, recursive CTEs, date & time, and analytics-style patterns.

A structured, GitHub-ready advanced SQL practice project focused on:
- Subqueries + EXISTS
- Correlated subqueries
- Window functions (aggregate, ranking, frames)
- LAG / LEAD
- CTEs (non-recursive + multi-CTE)
- Recursive CTEs (numbers + employee hierarchy)
- Date/Time functions

## How this repo is organized
- `archive/` → original work preserved **without any changes**
- `db/` → database setup + seed scripts
- `practice/` → practice questions + solutions organized by topic
- `run/` → one-command scripts to build/run
- `docs/` → learning path + documentation

## Status
Currently organizing and converting the original script into a clean practice workbook (no omissions).
