# Advanced SQL Practice

A practice-first SQL workbook: subqueries, correlated subqueries, window functions, CTEs, recursive CTEs, and date/time patterns — with clean prompts and separate solutions.

## What you’ll practice
- Subqueries + `EXISTS`
- Correlated subqueries
- Window functions (aggregate, ranking, frames)
- `LAG()` / `LEAD()`
- CTEs (non-recursive + multi-CTE)
- Recursive CTEs (numbers + employee hierarchy)
- Date/Time functions

## Repo structure
- `exercises/` → prompts-only (try first)
- `solutions/` → complete solutions (reference after)
- `db/` → local DB setup + seed scripts
- `docker-compose.yml` → optional local MySQL setup
- `docs/` → how to use + roadmap + style guide
- `archive/` → original work preserved **without changes**

## How to use
Start here: `docs/HOW_TO_USE.md`  
Exercise index: `exercises/README.md`

## Status
Actively organizing the original work into a clean, sequenced workbook (no omissions).
