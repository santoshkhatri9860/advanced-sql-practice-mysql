# Advanced SQL Practice

**Live site (GitHub Pages):** https://santoshkhatri9860.github.io/advanced-sql-practice-mysql/  
**Exercise Index:** https://github.com/santoshkhatri9860/advanced-sql-practice-mysql/blob/main/exercises/README.md  
**Quickstart (setup + smoke test):** https://github.com/santoshkhatri9860/advanced-sql-practice-mysql/blob/main/docs/QUICKSTART.md  

A practice-first SQL workbook with **1,400+ topic-wise questions** — from fundamentals to advanced patterns — built for **job prep, interviews, and real-world SQL fluency**.

Most sites explain advanced SQL concepts, but don’t provide enough **structured, high-volume practice**. This repo is designed to fix that: **prompts first**, then **separate solutions** so you can practice properly and verify fast.

**Best for:** learners • job seekers • interview prep • anyone leveling up SQL

---

## What you’ll practice
- Subqueries + `EXISTS`
- Correlated subqueries
- Window functions (aggregate, ranking, frames)
- `LAG()` / `LEAD()`
- CTEs (non-recursive + multi-CTE)
- Recursive CTEs (numbers + employee hierarchy)
- Date/Time functions

---

## Repo structure
- `exercises/` → prompts-only (try first)
- `solutions/` → complete solutions (reference after)
- `db/` → local DB setup + seed scripts
- `docker-compose.yml` → optional local MySQL setup
- `docs/` → how to use + roadmap + style guide
- `archive/` → original work preserved **without changes**

---

## Quick start
1) Read: `docs/HOW_TO_USE.md`  
2) Start practicing: `exercises/README.md`  
3) Check your work: `solutions/`  

> Want a local database with sample data? See `db/` (Docker is optional).

---

## Recommended learning path
1) Subqueries  
2) EXISTS + correlated subqueries  
3) Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK/DENSE_RANK)  
4) Window frames  
5) LAG/LEAD  
6) CTEs  
7) Recursive CTEs  
8) Date/Time patterns  

---

## Who this is for
- Beginners who know basic SQL and want to level up with real practice
- Data analysts preparing for SQL interviews
- Anyone who wants a structured workbook instead of random questions

---

## Notes
- **MySQL 8+ recommended** (for CTEs + window functions).
- SQL often has multiple correct answers — solutions are reference implementations.
