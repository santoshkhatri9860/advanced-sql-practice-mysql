# Advanced SQL Practice (MySQL 8)

A practice-first SQL workbook with **1,400+ topic-wise questions**—from 
fundamentals to advanced patterns—built for **job prep, interviews, and 
real-world SQL fluency**.

Most sites explain advanced SQL concepts, but don’t provide enough 
**structured, high-volume practice**. This repo is designed to fix that: 
**prompts first**, then **separate solutions** so you can practice properly and 
verify fast.

**Best for:** learners • job seekers • interview prep • recruiters assessing 
SQL readiness

---

## What you’ll practice
- Subqueries + `EXISTS`
- Correlated subqueries
- Window functions (aggregate, ranking, frames)
- `LAG()` / `LEAD()`
- CTEs (non-recursive + multi-CTE)
- Recursive CTEs (numbers + employee hierarchy)
- Date/Time functions

---

## Repo structure
- `exercises/` → prompts-only (try first)
- `solutions/` → complete solutions (reference after)
- `db/` → local DB setup + seed scripts
- `docker-compose.yml` → optional local MySQL setup
- `docs/` → how to use + roadmap + style guide
- `archive/` → original work preserved **without changes**

---

## Quick start (recommended)
1) Read: `docs/HOW_TO_USE.md`  
2) Start practicing: `exercises/README.md`  
3) Verify with: `solutions/`

> Want a local database with sample data? See `db/` (Docker is optional).

---

## Recommended learning path
1) Subqueries  
2) EXISTS + correlated subqueries  
3) Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK/DENSE_RANK)  
4) Window frames  
5) LAG/LEAD  
6) CTEs  
7) Recursive CTEs  
8) Date/Time patterns  

---

## Who this is for
- Beginners who know basic SQL and want to level up with real practice
- Data analysts preparing for SQL interviews
- Anyone who wants a structured workbook instead of random questions

---

## Notes
- MySQL 8+ recommended (for CTEs + window functions).
- SQL often has multiple correct answers—solutions are reference 
implementations.
